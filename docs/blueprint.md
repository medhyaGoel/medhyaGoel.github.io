## Original User Request:
I want to create a one-page personal website that I can deploy on github pages. It should look sleek, aesthetic and minimalist and include space for a short blurb about who I am and what I'm interested in, a link to my linkedIn and github, as well as a timeline of what I've been up to and links + descriptions to my projects. The timeline should have three overlapping lines (one representing everything I did with legalTech, another representing everything I did in government, and the third representing everything else I'm building). Build my website.

Here is an example UI:
